# Feed Reader Project

In this project I have defined unit tests using Jasmine.


## Instructions

Download all of the files in this repository and open the "index.html" file via a web browser.

# Defined Tests

### RSS feeds

* The feed is not empty
* A URL is defined & not empty
* A name is defined & not empty

### The menu

* The menu is hidden by default
* When clicked on the first time, the menu appears
* When clicked on the second time, the menu is hidden

### Initial Entries

* There is at least one entry in the feed container

### New Feed Selection

* Compares the text of the first feed to the next feed
  to make sure that the feed has changed in the view
